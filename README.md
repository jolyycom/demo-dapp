## Try JOLYY Demo Dapp on the Rinkeby testnet

This demo is currently running on the Rinkeby testnet. 
- [Overview and step-by-step instructions]()
- [Live Demo](http://demo.jolyy.com)

## Run Demo DApp

### 1. Check node version

Make sure you have `node` version 8.5.0 or greater

```
node --version
```

### 2. Set up DApp 

In a new tab:
```
git clone https://github.com/jolyycom/demo-dapp
npm install
npm run start
```

A browser will open to http://localhost:3000. If you don't have the MetaMask extension (or another wallet provider) follow instructions of the next step.


### 3. Set up MetaMask

- Install [MetaMask Chrome Browser Extension](https://metamask.io/).

- Follow the instructions to set up your wallet.

- Click where it says "Ethereum Main Network" and select "Rinkeby Test Network" or "Ropsten Test Network". This takes us off of the real Ethereum network and onto a test network. Ethers on test networks cannot be exchanged for fiat currency.

**Be careful not to mix up your test wallet with your real one on the Main Network.**

### 4. Get test ether

- Get Rinkeby ether from the [Rinkeby faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/).
- Get Ropsten ether from the [Ropsten faucet](https://faucet.metamask.io/).

### 5. Try it!

Create a listing and post it to IPFS and Ethereum.

## Run Demo DApp with local blockchain


### 6. Connect to your local blockchain in MetaMask
